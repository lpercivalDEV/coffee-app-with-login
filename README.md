# Coffee House app
This is a node.js and express application I made that allows baristas to login or create an account, submit customer orders, and check orders off as complete.

## Installation
1. Open your terminal/shell.
2. Clone my repo by typing in `git clone https://github.com/lpercivalDEV/coffee-app-with-login.git`
3. run `npm install`

## Usage
1. run `node server.js`
2. Navigate to `localhost:8080`

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Mongodb, Express, Passport

I created an application that allows a pretend coffee house to handle incoming orders.

The application uses a node server to host the files and passport for user login and authentication.

The "cashier" can submit orders that are then posted to the screen. Once the order has been made, workers can mark the order as complete by clicking on the "check mark" icon which turns green.

The orders are stored in a database and can be deleted by an "admin" once the shift is over.


## Optimizations

If I had more time, I would improve the CSS and also add the ability for items to be deleted once they are marked complete.

I would also add the ability to have timestamps for each order and also show who is marking the order as complete.
